A character array (`char array`) and `string` are both used to store sequences of characters in C++. However, there are some key differences between them:

1. **Type and Usage**:
   - `char array`: It is an array of characters (`char`). It's a fundamental data type in C++ used to represent strings as arrays of characters. Example: `char str[10];`.
   - `string`: It's a standard library class (`std::string`) that provides a higher-level abstraction for handling strings. It's part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Example: `std::string str;`.

2. **Size Flexibility**:
   - `char array`: The size of a character array needs to be specified at compile time and cannot be changed during runtime without creating a new array.
   - `string`: The size of a `string` object can change dynamically during runtime. You can append, insert, or remove characters without worrying about resizing the string explicitly.

3. **Null Termination**:
   - `char array`: In C-style strings (character arrays), a null character (`'\0'`) is used to denote the end of the string. This null terminator is required to indicate where the string ends.
   - `string`: The `string` class handles null termination internally. You don't need to worry about manually adding null terminators because the `string` object knows its size.

4. **Ease of Use**:
   - `char array`: Manipulating character arrays can be more error-prone and cumbersome, especially when dealing with tasks like memory management, appending, concatenation, or comparison.
   - `string`: The `string` class provides member functions and overloaded operators for easy string manipulation, making tasks such as concatenation, comparison, and substring extraction simpler and safer.

5. **Compatibility**:
   - `char array`: Character arrays have been a part of C since its inception, so they are widely used and compatible with C-style string functions.
   - `string`: While the `string` class is a part of the C++ standard library, it's not directly compatible with C-style functions. However, it provides methods to convert between C++ strings and C-style strings (`const char*`).

In summary, while both character arrays and `string` objects serve the purpose of storing strings, the `string` class offers more flexibility, safety, and ease of use compared to traditional character arrays.
